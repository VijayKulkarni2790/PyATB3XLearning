#Task 1

# Explain the diff bet = operator and the == oprator


a=5 # here = operator is assigne value to variable
b=5

print(a==b) # it rutuns boolean value
# it checks if two variables are same or not if same it return true or if tis not same it returns false

#  what is the ** oprator do in python and how is it used ?

# '**' operator acts as exponential power to value.

c=5
print("Squre of 5 is",c**2)
print("Cube of 5 is",c**3)

# what does the  ^ operator do in pyton and in what context is it commonly used?
# "^" oprator performs a bitwise Xor operator on two numbers
# it is commonly used in computer used in comupter science to perform bitwise operator on integers

d=20
e=5

print(d^e)
